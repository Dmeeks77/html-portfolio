<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Darcy Meeks; a passionate learner, creative soul, and aspiring tech
  professional based in Midland, Texas. I hold an Associate Degree in Computer
  Information Systems, and after years of nurturing my creativity through
  sewing, photography, and entrepreneurship, I've now fully stepped into the
  world of technology. I wake up early each morning to study web development,
  determined to master HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python—one line of code at a
  time. My journey may not be traditional, but it's deeply personal and fueled
  by growth, grit, and vision.

  Outside of my career goals, I'm a devoted mother, a lifelong dreamer, and a
  believer that it's never too late to rewrite your story. I’ve built
  businesses, learned from my challenges, and found beauty in starting over.
  Whether I’m writing code, designing websites, or capturing life through a
  lens, I pour my heart into everything I do. I know what it’s like to juggle
  responsibilities, work hard, and still chase something bigger. That’s why I
  share my journey, to encourage others who feel like they’re starting from
  scratch to believe in themselves again.

  This site is more than a portfolio, it's a living, breathing testimony of
  resilience, reinvention, and purpose. I’m so glad you’re here, Welcome to my
  world.
